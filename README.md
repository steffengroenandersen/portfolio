I created a portfolio website to showcase my projects, treating it as a project in itself. Inspired by LinkedIns design, I replicated its layout to explore and work with its user-friendly structure, which also works well for posting updates. The website was built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

Project is deployed here: https://steffengroenandersen.github.io/portfolio/
